The translation app will allow you to select the source and output language (source will also
allow auto-detect option) and will fetch the results from the Google API using provided API
key. Once the result is shown, users can set the phrase as favorite, which will be listed in the
second section of the app - the search favorite history. Favorites should be persistent even
if the app is restarted and stored locally on the device.
